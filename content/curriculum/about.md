subtitle: And why it helps your little ones learn
---

There’s an importance for young learners to have plenty of early learning experiences for them build the skills they need not only when entering school but also later in life.  Therefore, the Cathay School makes it a priority to embed these 21st Century Skills within our daily schedule. The Cathay School is a **dual-language immersion preschool**. Using our research based curriculum, our goal is to create a learning environment where students are aware of the Chinese language and graduate from our Preschool with more than a small grasp and command of the language.  Research has shown that best time for a child to learn or be introduced to a new language is within the first three to four years of life.  Therefore, we are dedicated to offer a balanced and linguistically appropriate environment for our young learners.

With in-depth research, the Cathay School uses **the Creative Curriculum<sup>®</sup>** for Preschool.  The Creative Curriculum is a research-based, comprehensive collection of knowledge building and daily practice resources that explains the “what,” “why,” and “how” of learning. It is a comprehensive, research-based curriculum that features exploration and discovery as a way of learning, enabling children to develop **confidence, creativity, and lifelong critical thinking skills**. It is designed to ensure that students are a part of a developmentally appropriate and content-rich program for children with diverse backgrounds and skill levels.  The Creative Curriculum delivers hands-on and project-based investigations of topics that are relevant to children’s everyday experiences.
